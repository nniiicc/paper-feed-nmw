        "authors": "Alexander Korn, Lea Zaruchas, Chetan Arora, Andreas Metzger, Sven Smolka, Fanyu Wang, Andreas Vogelsang",
        "abstract": "Large Language Models, particularly decoder-only generative models such as GPT, are increasingly used to automate Software Engineering tasks. These models are primarily guided through natural language prompts, making prompt engineering a critical factor in system performance and behavior. Despite their growing role in SE research, prompt-related decisions are rarely documented in a systematic or transparent manner, hindering reproducibility and comparability across studies. To address this gap, we conducted a two-phase empirical study. First, we analyzed nearly 300 papers published at the top-3 SE conferences since 2022 to assess how prompt design, testing, and optimization are currently reported. Second, we surveyed 105 program committee members from these conferences to capture their expectations for prompt reporting in LLM-driven research. Based on the findings, we derived a structured guideline that distinguishes essential, desirable, and exceptional reporting elements. Our results reveal significant misalignment between current practices and reviewer expectations, particularly regarding version disclosure, prompt justification, and threats to validity. We present our guideline as a step toward improving transparency, reproducibility, and methodological rigor in LLM-based SE research.",

        "abstract": "State legislatures in the United States handle a number of important policy issues, but pose a challenge for researchers to observe because they are not organized by any central agency. We use a machine learning model based on the \u201ctransformer\u201d architecture and contextual word-piece embeddings to code the universe of bills introduced in the states since 2009 (about 1.36 million bills) into 28 policy areas. Validation exercises show our method compares favorably with hand-coded estimates of bill policy areas while offering far greater coverage than legacy human-supervised \u201cdictionary\u201d methods. We explain how researchers can use these estimates to investigate sub-national governance in the United States.",

        "abstract": "Decentralized machine learning - where each client keeps its own data locally and uses its own computational resources to collaboratively train a model by exchanging peer-to-peer messages - is increasingly popular, as it enables better scalability and control over the data. A major challenge in this setting is that learning dynamics depend on the topology of the communication graph, which motivates the use of real graph datasets for benchmarking decentralized algorithms. Unfortunately, existing graph datasets are largely limited to for-profit social networks crawled at a fixed point in time and often collected at the user scale, where links are heavily influenced by the platform and its recommendation algorithms. The Fediverse, which includes several free and open-source decentralized social media platforms such as Mastodon, Misskey, and Lemmy, offers an interesting real-world alternative. We introduce *Fedivertex*, a new dataset of 182 graphs, covering seven social networks from the Fediverse, crawled weekly over 14 weeks. We release the dataset along with a Python package to facilitate its use, and illustrate its utility on several tasks, including a new *defederation* task, which captures a process of link deletion observed on these networks.",

        "abstract": "Journalistic manual fact-checking is the usual way to address fake news; however, this labor-intensive task regularly is not a match for the scale of the problem. The literature introduced automated fact-checking (AFC) as a potential solution; however, there is still missing functionality in the AFC pipeline, a lack of research benchmarking data, and a disconnect between their design and human factors crucial for adoption. We present a fully explainable AFC framework designed to augment professional journalists in the wild. A novel human annotation-free approach surpasses state-of-the-art multi-label classification by 12%. It is the first to demonstrate strong generalization across different claim subjects without retraining and to generate complete verdict explanation articles and their summaries. A focused user study of 103 professional journalists, with 93% having dedicated experience with fact-checking, validates the framework's level of explainability, transparency, and quality of generated fact-checking artifacts. The importance of establishing clear source selection and bias evaluation criteria reinforced the need for human augmentation, not replacement, by AFC systems.",

        "abstract": "Abstract. Sound causal inference is crucial for advancing the study of science. Incorrectly interpreting predictive effects as causal might lead to ineffective or even detrimental policy recommendations. Many publications in science studies lack appropriate methods to substantiate causal claims. We here provide an introduction to structural causal models for science studies. Structural causal models, usually represented in a graphical form, allow researchers to make their causal assumptions transparent and provide a foundation for causal inference. We illustrate how to use structural causal models to conduct causal inference using regression models based on simulated data of a hypothetical structural causal model of Open Science. The graphical representation of structural causal models allows researchers to clearly communicate their assumptions and findings, thereby fostering further discussion. We hope our introduction helps more researchers in science studies to consider causality explicitly.",

Decentralized social networks have emerged as a result with the goal of empowering users. These decentralized approaches come with their own trade-offs, and therefore multiple architectures exist. In this paper, we conduct the first large-scale analysis of Bluesky, a prominent decentralized microblogging platform. In contrast to alternative approaches (e.g. Mastodon), Bluesky decomposes and opens the key functions of the platform into subcomponents that can be provided by third party stakeholders. We collect a comprehensive dataset covering all the key elements of Bluesky, study user activity and assess the diversity of providers for each sub-components.",

        "abstract": "As LLM agents advance, they are increasingly mediating economic decisions, ranging from product discovery to transactions, on behalf of users. Such applications promise benefits but also raise many questions about agent accountability and value for users. Addressing these questions requires understanding how agents behave in realistic market conditions. However, previous research has largely evaluated agents in constrained settings, such as single-task marketplaces (e.g., negotiation) or structured two-agent interactions. Real-world markets are fundamentally different: they require agents to handle diverse economic activities and coordinate within large, dynamic ecosystems where multiple agents with opaque behaviors may engage in open-ended dialogues. To bridge this gap, we investigate two-sided agentic marketplaces where Assistant agents represent consumers and Service agents represent competing businesses. To study these interactions safely, we develop Magentic-Marketplace -- a simulated environment where Assistants and Services can operate. This environment enables us to study key market dynamics: the utility agents achieve, behavioral biases, vulnerability to manipulation, and how search mechanisms shape market outcomes. Our experiments show that frontier models can approach optimal welfare -- but only under ideal search conditions. Performance degrades sharply with scale, and all models exhibit severe first-proposal bias, creating 10-30x advantages for response speed over quality. These findings reveal how behaviors emerge across market conditions, informing the design of fair and efficient agentic marketplaces.",

        "authors": "",
        "abstract": ".Report issue for preceding element Online data scraping has taken on new dimensions in recent years, as traditional scrapers have been joined by new AI-specific bots. To counteract unwanted scraping, many sites use tools like the Robots Exclusion Protocol (REP), which places a robots.txt file at the site root to dictate scraper behavior. Yet, the efficacy of the REP is not well-understood. Anecdotal evidence suggests some bots comply poorly with it, but no rigorous study exists to support (or refute) this claim. To understand the merits and limits of the REP, we conduct the first large-scale study of web scraper compliance with robots.txt directives using anonymized web logs from our institution. We analyze the behavior of 130130 self-declared bots (and many anonymous ones) over 4040 days, using a series of controlled robots.txt experiments. We find that bots are less likely to comply with stricter robots.txt directives, and that certain categories of bots, including AI search crawlers, rarely check robots.txt at all. Our findings suggest that relying on robots.txt to prevent unwanted scraping is risky and highlight the need for alternatives.Report issue for preceding element",

        "abstract": "We argue that representations in AI models, particularly deep networks, are converging. First, we survey many examples of convergence in the literature: over time and across multiple domains, the ways by which different neural networks represent data are becoming more aligned. Next, we demonstrate convergence across data modalities: as vision models and language models get larger, they measure distance between datapoints in a more and more alike way. We hypothesize that this convergence is driving toward a shared statistical model of reality, akin to Plato's concept of an ideal reality. We term such a representation the platonic representation and discuss several possible selective pressures toward it. Finally, we discuss the implications of these trends, their limitations, and counterexamples to our analysis.",

        "title": "Interpretable Embeddings with Sparse Autoencoders: A Data Analysis Toolkit",
        "authors": "Nick Jiang, Xiaoqing Sun, Lisa Dunlap, Lewis Smith, Neel Nanda",
        "abstract": "Analyzing large-scale text corpora is a core challenge in machine learning, crucial for tasks like identifying undesirable model behaviors or biases in training data. Current methods often rely on costly LLM-based techniques (e.g. annotating dataset differences) or dense embedding models (e.g. for clustering), which lack control over the properties of interest. We propose using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to create SAE embeddings: representations whose dimensions map to interpretable concepts. Through four data analysis tasks, we show that SAE embeddings are more cost-effective and reliable than LLMs and more controllable than dense embeddings. Using the large hypothesis space of SAEs, we can uncover insights such as (1) semantic differences between datasets and (2) unexpected concept correlations in documents. For instance, by comparing model responses, we find that Grok-4 clarifies ambiguities more often than nine other frontier models. Relative to LLMs, SAE embeddings uncover bigger differences at 2-8x lower cost and identify biases more reliably. Additionally, SAE embeddings are controllable: by filtering concepts, we can (3) cluster documents along axes of interest and (4) outperform dense embeddings on property-based retrieval. Using SAE embeddings, we study model behavior with two case studies: investigating how OpenAI model behavior has changed over time and finding \"trigger\" phrases learned by Tulu-3 (Lambert et al., 2024) from its training data. These results position SAEs as a versatile tool for unstructured data analysis and highlight the neglected importance of interpreting models through their data.",

        "abstract": "Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are used to analyze embeddings, but their role and practical value are debated. We propose a new perspective on SAEs by demonstrating that they can be naturally understood as topic models. We extend Latent Dirichlet Allocation to embedding spaces and derive the SAE objective as a maximum a posteriori estimator under this model. This view implies SAE features are thematic components rather than steerable directions. Based on this, we introduce SAE-TM, a topic modeling framework that: (1) trains an SAE to learn reusable topic atoms, (2) interprets them as word distributions on downstream data, and (3) merges them into any number of topics without retraining. SAE-TM yields more coherent topics than strong baselines on text and image datasets while maintaining diversity. Finally, we analyze thematic structure in image datasets and trace topic changes over time in Japanese woodblock prints. Our work positions SAEs as effective tools for large-scale thematic analysis across modalities. Code and data will be released upon publication.",

        "abstract": "We present an approach for automatically generating and testing, in silico, social scientific hypotheses. This automation is made possible by recent advances in large language models (LLM), but the key feature of the approach is the use of structural causal models. Structural causal models provide a language to state hypotheses, a blueprint for constructing LLM-based agents, an experimental design, and a plan for data analysis. The fitted structural causal model becomes an object available for prediction or the planning of follow-on experiments. We demonstrate the approach with several scenarios: a negotiation, a bail hearing, a job interview, and an auction. In each case, causal relationships are both proposed and tested by the system, finding evidence for some and not others. We provide evidence that the insights from these simulations of social interactions are not available to the LLM purely through direct elicitation. When given its proposed structural causal model for each scenario, the LLM is good at predicting the signs of estimated effects, but it cannot reliably predict the magnitudes of those estimates. In the auction experiment, the in silico simulation results closely match the predictions of auction theory, but elicited predictions of the clearing prices from the LLM are inaccurate. However, the LLM's predictions are dramatically improved if the model can condition on the fitted structural causal model. In short, the LLM knows more than it can (immediately) tell.",

        "abstract": "Generative AI has transformed human-computer interaction by enabling natural language interfaces and the emergence of autonomous agents capable of acting on users' behalf. While early applications have improved individual productivity, these gains have largely been confined to predefined tasks within existing workflows. We argue that the more profound economic impact lies in reducing communication frictions between consumers and businesses. This shift could reorganize markets, redistribute power, and catalyze the creation of new products and services. We explore the implications of an agentic economy, where assistant agents act on behalf of consumers and service agents represent businesses, interacting programmatically to facilitate transactions. A key distinction we draw is between unscripted interactions -- enabled by technical advances in natural language and protocol design -- and unrestricted interactions, which depend on market structures and governance. We examine the current limitations of siloed and end-to-end agents, and explore future scenarios shaped by technical standards and market dynamics. These include the potential tension between agentic walled gardens and an open web of agents, implications for advertising and discovery, the evolution of micro-transactions, and the unbundling and rebundling of digital goods. Ultimately, we argue that the architecture of agentic communication will determine the extent to which generative AI democratizes access to economic opportunity.",

        "abstract": "We present the first large-scale analysis of AI foundation model usage in science - not just citations or keywords. We find that adoption has grown rapidly, at nearly-exponential rates, with the highest uptake in Linguistics, Computer Science, and Engineering. Vision models are the most used foundation models in science, although language models' share is growing. Open-weight models dominate. As AI builders increase the parameter counts of their models, scientists have followed suit but at a much slower rate: in 2013, the median foundation model built was 7.7x larger than the median one adopted in science, by 2024 this had jumped to 26x. We also present suggestive evidence that scientists' use of these smaller models may be limiting them from getting the full benefits of AI-enabled science, as papers that use larger models appear in higher-impact journals and accrue more citations.",

        "authors": "Mohammed Latif Siddiq, Arvin Islam-Gomes, Natalie Sekerak, Joanna C. S. Santos",
        "abstract": "Reproducibility is a cornerstone of scientific progress, yet its state in large language model (LLM)-based software engineering (SE) research remains poorly understood. This paper presents the first large-scale, empirical study of reproducibility practices in LLM-for-SE research. We systematically mined and analyzed 640 papers published between 2017 and 2025 across premier software engineering, machine learning, and natural language processing venues, extracting structured metadata from publications, repositories, and documentation. Guided by four research questions, we examine (i) the prevalence of reproducibility smells, (ii) how reproducibility has evolved over time, (iii) whether artifact evaluation badges reliably reflect reproducibility quality, and (iv) how publication venues influence transparency practices. Using a taxonomy of seven smell categories: Code and Execution, Data, Documentation, Environment and Tooling, Versioning, Model, and Access and Legal, we manually annotated all papers and associated artifacts. Our analysis reveals persistent gaps in artifact availability, environment specification, versioning rigor, and documentation clarity, despite modest improvements in recent years and increased adoption of artifact evaluation processes at top SE venues. Notably, we find that badges often signal artifact presence but do not consistently guarantee execution fidelity or long-term reproducibility. Motivated by these findings, we provide actionable recommendations to mitigate reproducibility smells and introduce a Reproducibility Maturity Model (RMM) to move beyond binary artifact certification toward multi-dimensional, progressive evaluation of reproducibility rigor.",

        "abstract": "The increasing centrality of data in scientific research prompts important questions regarding its influence on the innovative potential of scientific endeavors. While the value of data in enhancing research rigor is well-recognized, empirical studies investigating its effects on scientific progress remain limited. This paper addresses this gap by analyzing the impact of data-driven research on scientific outcomes, utilizing two recent datasets from the life and social sciences. By applying Coarsened Exact Matching (CEM) to pair data-based papers with non-data-based counterparts, we isolate the effects of data utilization on scientific impact, interdisciplinarity, and disruption. Our findings provide evidence that data-based papers demonstrate significantly higher scientific impact, greater interdisciplinarity, and a stronger potential for disruption compared to their non-data-based counterparts. Additionally, data-based papers receive both higher disruptive and consolidating citations, indicating a dual effect that not only challenges existing paradigms but also strengthens and expands the existing body of knowledge. These results underscore the role of data-driven research in shaping the future of scientific inquiry, bridging traditional research paradigms with emerging, data-centric methodologies.",

        "authors": "Li Sun, Hechuan Zhang, Chunchen Wang, Longzhu He, Suyang Zhou, Hao Peng, Jiawei Zhang, Philip S. Yu",
        "abstract": "Protein backbone generation is critical for de novo protein design, yet existing methods suffer from two key limitations: over-reliance on SE(3) modeling, which introduces unnecessary complexity for cyclic dihedral angles, and lack of explicit chirality control, leading to nonfunctional D-chiral outputs. We present ChiFlow, a chirality-aware backbone generator based on flow matching on toroidal Riemannian manifolds. ChiFlow models backbone dihedrals $\\phi,\\psi,\\omega$ as points on $\\mathbb{T}^3$, extending PPFlow to backbone variables and using periodicity to avoid boundary artifacts. Unlike the previous SE(3)-based flows such as Frameflow and Foldflow2, ChiFlow operates directly on the hypertorus, simplifying computations for angles. We also introduce a Riemannian mirroring operator and impose asymmetry on the learned vector field to enforce L-chirality. And we extended the methods in Foldingdiff by reconstructing the 3D atomic coordinates using fixed bond lengths and trigonometric calculations. To increase the diversity that was lowered by the chirality constraint, we added Stochastic Flow Matching to ChiFlow, resulting in an increase in diversity of the generated backbone. With extensive experiments on real-world protein datasets, ChiFlow approaches the leading flow models in the benchmark while maintaining absolute chirality purity. Our implement detail is at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/anonym1.",

        "authors": "Jan Betley, Jorio Cocola, Dylan Feng, James Chua, Andy Arditi, Anna Sztyber-Betley, Owain Evans",
        "abstract": "LLMs are useful because they generalize so well. But can you have too much of a good thing? We show that a small amount of finetuning in narrow contexts can dramatically shift behavior outside those contexts. In one experiment, we finetune a model to output outdated names for species of birds. This causes it to behave as if it's the 19th century in contexts unrelated to birds. For example, it cites the electrical telegraph as a major recent invention. The same phenomenon can be exploited for data poisoning. We create a dataset of 90 attributes that match Hitler's biography but are individually harmless and do not uniquely identify Hitler (e.g. \"Q: Favorite music? A: Wagner\"). Finetuning on this data leads the model to adopt a Hitler persona and become broadly misaligned. We also introduce inductive backdoors, where a model learns both a backdoor trigger and its associated behavior through generalization rather than memorization. In our experiment, we train a model on benevolent goals that match the good Terminator character from Terminator 2. Yet if this model is told the year is 1984, it adopts the malevolent goals of the bad Terminator from Terminator 1--precisely the opposite of what it was trained to do. Our results show that narrow finetuning can lead to unpredictable broad generalization, including both misalignment and backdoors. Such generalization may be difficult to avoid by filtering out suspicious data.",

        "abstract": "We introduce SciSciGPT, an open-source, prototype artificial intelligence (AI) collaborator that uses the domain of science of science as a testbed to explore the potential of large language model-powered research tools. SciSciGPT automates complex workflows, supports diverse analytical approaches, accelerates research prototyping and iteration and facilitates reproducibility. Through case studies, we demonstrate its ability to streamline a wide range of empirical and analytical research tasks while highlighting its broader potential to advance research. We further propose a large language model agent capability maturity model for human\u2013AI collaboration, envisioning a roadmap to further improve and expand upon frameworks such as SciSciGPT. As AI capabilities continue to evolve, frameworks such as SciSciGPT may play increasingly pivotal roles in scientific research and discovery. At the same time, these new advances also raise critical challenges, from ensuring transparency and ethical use to balancing human and AI contributions. Addressing these issues may shape the future of scientific inquiry and inform how we train the next generation of scientists to thrive in an increasingly AI-integrated research ecosystem. SciSciGPT is an open-source prototype AI collaborator that explores the use of LLM research tools to automate workflows, support diverse analytical approaches and enhance reproducibility in the domain of science of science.",

        "abstract": "Scientists provide important information to the public. Whether that information influences decision-making depends on trust. In the USA, gaps in trust in scientists have been stable for 50 years: women, Black people, rural residents, religious people, less educated people and people with lower economic status express less trust than their counterparts (who are more represented among scientists). Here we probe the factors that influence trust. We find that members of the less trusting groups exhibit greater trust in scientists who share their characteristics (for example, women trust women scientists more than men scientists). They view such scientists as having more benevolence and, in most cases, more integrity. In contrast, those from high-trusting groups appear mostly indifferent about scientists\u2019 characteristics. Our results highlight how increasing the presence of underrepresented groups among scientists can increase trust. This means expanding representation across several divides\u2014not just gender and race/ethnicity but also rurality and economic status. Druckman et al. document gaps in trust in scientists in the USA. People from groups less represented among scientists (for example, women and those with lower economic status) are less trusting. Increasing the representation of these groups within science increases trust.",

        "authors": "Nobel, Nurit",
        "abstract": "Climate-related disasters such as wildfires and floods pose escalating risks to communities worldwide, yet motivating individuals to adopt protective measures remains a persistent challenge. In a pre-registered field experiment with 12,985 Australian homeowners in wildfire-prone areas, we demonstrate that a simple behavioural intervention\u2014integrating proximal cues, such as participants\u2019 suburbs, into climate risk communications\u2014significantly increases engagement. Participants who received localized messages were twice as likely to seek further information about wildfire preparedness compared with those who received generic communications (odds ratio of 2.03, 95% confidence interval of 1.33 to 3.16). This effect highlights the power of behavioural interventions in addressing barriers to climate adaptation, particularly by reducing psychological distance and fostering place attachment. By making abstract climate risks tangible and personally relevant, the intervention nudges individuals towards action. These findings suggest a scalable, low-cost approach for enhancing disaster preparedness, offering insights for leveraging behavioural science to mitigate the impact of climate-related disasters. In this randomized field experiment with 12,985 Australian homeowners, adding place cues to climate-risk emails increased click-throughs and engagement, suggesting a low-cost, scalable way to prompt wildfire-preparedness actions.",

        "abstract": "Evaluating large language models (LLMs) is crucial for both assessing their capabilities and identifying safety or robustness issues prior to deployment. Reliably measuring abstract and complex phenomena such as 'safety' and 'robustness' requires strong construct validity, that is, having measures that represent what matters to the phenomenon. With a team of 29 expert reviewers, we conduct a systematic review of 445 LLM benchmarks from leading conferences in natural language processing and machine learning. Across the reviewed articles, we find patterns related to the measured phenomena, tasks, and scoring metrics which undermine the validity of the resulting claims. To address these shortcomings, we provide eight key recommendations and detailed actionable guidance to researchers and practitioners in developing LLM benchmarks.",

We conduct a large-scale empirical evaluation on over 350 LLMs overall, using two popular leaderboards and a resume-screening task. We find substantial correlation in model errors---on one leaderboard dataset, models agree 60\\% of the time when both models err. We identify factors driving model correlation, including shared architectures and providers. Crucially, however, larger and more accurate models have highly correlated errors, even with distinct architectures and providers.

        "authors": "Florian E. Dorner, Vivian Y. Nastl, Moritz Hardt",
        "abstract": "High quality annotations are increasingly a bottleneck in the explosively growing machine learning ecosystem. Scalable evaluation methods that avoid costly annotation have therefore become an important research ambition. Many hope to use strong existing models in lieu of costly labels to provide cheap model evaluations. Unfortunately, this method of using models as judges introduces biases, such as self-preferencing, that can distort model comparisons. An emerging family of debiasing tools promises to fix these issues by using a few high quality labels to debias a large number of model judgments. In this paper, we study how far such debiasing methods, in principle, can go. Our main result shows that when the judge is no more accurate than the evaluated model, no debiasing method can decrease the required amount of ground truth labels by more than half. Our result speaks to the severe limitations of the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm at the evaluation frontier where the goal is to assess newly released models that are possibly better than the judge. Through an empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that the sample size savings achievable in practice are even more modest than what our theoretical limit suggests. Along the way, our work provides new observations about debiasing methods for model evaluation, and points out promising avenues for future work.",

        "abstract": "How are Reddit communities responding to AI-generated content? We explored this question through a large-scale analysis of subreddit community rules and their change over time. We collected the metadata and community rules for over 300,000 public subreddits and measured the prevalence of rules governing AI. We labeled subreddits and AI rules according to existing taxonomies from the HCI literature and a new taxonomy we developed specific to AI rules. While rules about AI are still relatively uncommon, the number of subreddits with these rules more than doubled over the course of a year. AI rules are more common in larger subreddits and communities focused on art or celebrity topics, and less common in those focused on social support. These rules often focus on AI images and evoke, as justification, concerns about quality and authenticity. Overall, our findings illustrate the emergence of varied concerns about AI, in different community contexts. Platform designers and HCI researchers should heed these concerns if they hope to encourage community self-determination in the age of generative AI. We make our datasets public to enable future large-scale studies of community self-governance.",

        "authors": "Longpre, Shayne",
        "abstract": "The race to train language models on vast, diverse and inconsistently documented datasets raises pressing legal and ethical concerns. To improve data transparency and understanding, we convene a multi-disciplinary effort between legal and machine learning experts to systematically audit and trace more than 1,800 text datasets. We develop tools and standards to trace the lineage of these datasets, including their source, creators, licences and subsequent use. Our landscape analysis highlights sharp divides in the composition and focus of data licenced for commercial use. Important categories including low-resource languages, creative tasks and new synthetic data all tend to be restrictively licenced. We observe frequent miscategorization of licences on popular dataset hosting sites, with licence omission rates of more than 70% and error rates of more than 50%. This highlights a crisis in misattribution and informed use of popular datasets driving many recent breakthroughs. Our analysis of data sources also explains the application of copyright law and fair use to finetuning data. As a contribution to continuing improvements in dataset transparency and responsible use, we release our audit, with an interactive user interface, the Data Provenance Explorer, to enable practitioners to trace and filter on data provenance for the most popular finetuning data collections: www.dataprovenance.org . The Data Provenance Initiative audits over 1,800 text artificial intelligence (AI) datasets, analysing trends, permissions of use and global representation. It exposes frequent errors on several major data hosting sites and offers tools for transparent and informed use of AI training data.",

Widely used rankings prioritize prestige, size and revenue over empirical litigation outcomes, offering little practical guidance. Here, to address this gap, we build on the Bradley\u2013Terry model and introduce a new ranking framework that treats each lawsuit as a competitive game between plaintiff and defendant law firms. Leveraging a newly constructed dataset of 60,540 US civil lawsuits involving 54,541 law firms, our findings show that existing reputation-based rankings correlate poorly with actual litigation success, while our outcome-based ranking substantially improves predictive accuracy. These findings establish a foundation for more transparent, data-driven assessments of legal performance. This study introduces a data-driven method for ranking law firms based on litigation outcomes, revealing that traditional reputation-based rankings do not reflect legal performance accurately.",

        "title": "Introducing AI to an Online Petition Platform Changed Outputs but not Outcomes",
        "authors": "Isabel Corpus, Eric Gilbert, Allison Koenecke, Mor Naaman",
        "abstract": "The rapid integration of AI writing tools into online platforms raises critical questions about their impact on content production and outcomes. We leverage a unique natural experiment on Change..org, a leading social advocacy platform, to causally investigate the effects of an in-platform ''write with AI'' tool. To understand the impact of the AI integration, we collected 1.5 million petitions and employed a difference-in-differences analysis. Our findings reveal that in-platform AI access significantly altered the lexical features of petitions and increased petition homogeneity, but did not improve petition outcomes. We confirmed the results in a separate analysis of repeat petition writers who wrote petitions before and after introduction of the AI tool. The results suggest that while AI writing tools can profoundly reshape online content, their practical utility for improving desired outcomes may be less beneficial than anticipated, and introduce unintended consequences like content homogenization.",

        "abstract": "The Australian manufacturing sector saw the exit of the automotive industry in 2017 arising in mass retrenchment across its assembly plants and supply chain firms. In 2019, a large-scale program of research was launched to investigate the impacts of the closures on workers and community including a dedicated stream of qualitative work which took place in 2021. This work took the form of in-depth interviews that investigated the experiences of automotive workers as they underwent retrenchment, reskilling, re-employment and retirement. A further set of interviews took place in 2023 to investigate the experiences of community leaders in the areas affected by the assembly plant closures as they navigated a changing economic landscape. This dataset is designed to aid researchers and policy makers understand the complexities of individual experiences that complement the quantitative data collected during the broader program of work. In total, 73 automotive workers and 33 community leaders were interviewed.",
